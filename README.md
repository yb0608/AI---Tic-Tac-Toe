# AI---Tic-Tac-Toe
### An implementation of the Tic-Tac-Toe Game using a Minimax algorithm.

There are two main files in this project: runner.py and tictactoe.py. 

runner.py provided and it contains all of the code to run the graphical interface for the game.

tictactoe.py was implemented by myself, and it contains all of the logic and function for playing the game, and using the algorithm for making optimal moves.

## Getting Started

1. Once in the directory for the project, run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` to install the required Python package (pygame) for this project.

2. Then run `python runner.py` and play against your AI. 

Have Fun!
